The GSS gathers data on contemporary American society in order to monitor and explain trends and constants in attitudes, behaviours, and attributes.
Hundreds of trends have been tracked since 1972.
In addition, since the GSS adopted questions from earlier surveys, trends can be followed for up to 70 years.

The GSS contains a standard core of demographic, behavioural, and attitudinal questions, plus topics of special interest.
Among the topics covered are civil liberties, crime and violence, intergroup tolerance, morality, national spending priorities, psychological well-being, social mobility, and stress and traumatic events.

In this assignment we analyze data from the 2016 GSS, using it to estimate values of population parameters of interest about US adults.[^hw-08-exploring-gss-1]


## Warm up

Before we introduce the data, let's warm up with some simple exercises.
Update the YAML of your R Markdown file with your information, knit, commit, and push your changes.
Make sure to commit with a meaningful commit message.
Then, go to your repo on GitHub and confirm that your changes are visible in your Rmd **and** md files.
If anything is missing, commit and push again.

## Packages

We'll use the **tidyverse** package for much of the data wrangling and visualisation and the data lives in the **dsbox** package.

You will need to install the packages and to install dsbox copy the following code into the console: 

```
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("tidyverse/dsbox")
```

You can load them by running the following in your Console:

```{r load-packages, message = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
library(dsbox)
```

## Data

The data can be found in the **dsbox** package, and it's called `gss16`.
Since the dataset is distributed with the package, we don't need to load it separately; it becomes available to us when we load the package.
You can find out more about the dataset by inspecting its documentation, which you can access by running `?gss16` in the Console or using the Help menu in RStudio to search for `gss16`.
You can also find this information [here](https://rstudio-education.github.io/dsbox/reference/gss16.html).

# Exercises

## Part 1: Harassment at work

In 2016, the GSS added a new question on harassment at work.
The question is phrased as the following.

> *Over the past five years, have you been harassed by your superiors or co-workers at your job, for example, have you experienced any bullying, physical or psychological abuse?*

Answers to this question are stored in the `harass5` variable in our dataset.

1.  What are the possible responses to this question and how many respondents chose each of these answers?

```{r}

response_counts <- table(gss16$harass5)
response_table <- as.data.frame(response_counts)
colnames(response_table) <- c("Response", "Count")

print(response_table)
```


2.  What percent of the respondents for whom this question is applicable\
    (i.e. excluding `NA`s and `Does not apply`s) have been harassed by their superiors or co-workers at their job.
    
```{r}
valid_responses <- gss16$harass5[!is.na(gss16$harass5) & gss16$harass5 != "Does not apply"]

total_valid <- length(valid_responses)
harassed_count <- sum(valid_responses == "Yes")
harassed_proportion <- harassed_count / total_valid
harassed_percentage <- harassed_proportion * 100

harassed_percentage
```

## Part 2: Time spent on email

The 2016 GSS also asked respondents how many hours and minutes they spend on email weekly.
The responses to these questions are recorded in the `emailhr` and `emailmin` variables.
For example, if the response is 2.5 hrs, this would be recorded as `emailhr = 2` and `emailmin = 30`.

3.  Create a new variable called `email` that combines these two variables to reports the number of minutes the respondents spend on email weekly.

```{r}
gss16$email <- (gss16$emailhr * 60) + gss16$emailmin
```


4.  Visualize the distribution of this new variable.
    Find the mean and the median number of minutes respondents spend on email weekly.
    Is the mean or the median a better measure of the typical among of time Americans spend on email weekly?
    Why?

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(gss16, aes(x = email)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 200, fill = "skyblue", color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Weekly Email Time (in Minutes)", x = "Minutes", y = "Frequency") +
  theme_minimal()
```

```{r}

mean_email <- mean(gss16$email, na.rm = TRUE)
median_email <- median(gss16$email, na.rm = TRUE)

print(paste("Mean =", mean_email))
print(paste("Median =", median_email))

```

***Since data is skewed to the right, the median is the better option because the outliers could make the average number not accurate.***

5.  Create another new variable, `snap_insta` that is coded as "Yes" if the respondent reported using any of Snapchat (`snapchat`) or Instagram (`instagrm`), and "No" if not.
    If the recorded value was `NA` for both of these questions, the value in your new variable should also be `NA`.
    
```{r}
gss16$snap_insta <- ifelse(
  (!is.na(gss16$snapchat) & gss16$snapchat == "Yes") | 
  (!is.na(gss16$instagrm) & gss16$instagrm == "Yes"), 
  "Yes", 
  ifelse(is.na(gss16$snapchat) & is.na(gss16$instagrm), NA, "No")
)

```


6. Calculate the percentage of Yes's for `snap_insta` among those who answered the question, i.e. excluding `NA`s.

```{r}
responses <- gss16$snap_insta[!is.na(gss16$snap_insta)]

valid <- length(responses)
count <- sum(responses == "Yes")
proportion <- count / valid
percentage <- proportion * 100

percentage
```


7.  What are the possible responses to the question *Last week were you working full time, part time, going to school, keeping house, or what?* and how many respondents chose each of these answers?
    Note that this information is stored in the `wrkstat` variable.
    
```{r}
counts <- table(gss16$wrkstat)
table <- as.data.frame(counts)
colnames(table) <- c("Response", "Count")

print(table)
```

8.  Fit a model predicting `email` (number of minutes per week spent on email) from `educ` (number of years of education), `wrkstat`, and `snap_insta`.
    Interpret the slopes for each of these variables.
    
```{r}

library(tidyverse)
library(tidymodels)

model <- linear_reg() %>%
  set_engine("lm") %>%
  fit(email ~ educ + wrkstat + snap_insta, data = gss16)

tidy(model)
```

***The slope of the variables are either positive or negative. A positive slope means that specific variable is associated with more minutes spent on email. A negative slope means that that specific variable is associated with less minutes spent on email. The larger the number related to the varible means that it has a stronger positive effect on email.***

9.  Create a predicted values vs. residuals plot for this model.
    Are there any issues with the model?
    If yes, describe them.

```{r}

predicted_values <- predict(model, new_data = gss16)$.pred
residuals <- gss16$email - predicted_values

plot(predicted_values, residuals, 
     main = "Predicted Values vs. Residuals",
     xlab = "Predicted Values", 
     ylab = "Residuals",
     pch = 19, col = "blue")

```
***There seems to be an issue because there are a lot of positive values that almost seem like outliers because they are not in the cluster.***

## Part 3: Political views and science research

The 2016 GSS also asked respondents whether they think of themselves as liberal or conservative (`polviews`) and whether they think science research is necessary and should be supported by the federal government (`advfront`).

-   The question on science research is worded as follows:

> Even if it brings no immediate benefits, scientific research that advances the frontiers of knowledge is necessary and should be supported by the federal government.

And possible responses to this question are Strongly agree, Agree, Disagree, Strongly disagree, Don't know, No answer, Not applicable.

-   The question on political views is worded as follows:

> We hear a lot of talk these days about liberals and conservatives.
> I'm going to show you a seven-point scale on which the political views that people might hold are arranged from extremely liberal--point 1--to extremely conservative--point 7.
> Where would you place yourself on this scale?


**Note:** The levels of this variables are spelled inconsistently: "Extremely liberal" vs. "Extrmly conservative". Since this is the spelling that shows up in the data, you need to make sure this is how you spell the levels in your code.


And possible responses to this question are Extremely liberal, Liberal, Slightly liberal, Moderate, Slghtly conservative, Conservative, Extrmly conservative.
Responses that were originally Don't know, No answer and Not applicable are already mapped to `NA`s upon data import.

10. In a new variable, recode `advfront` such that Strongly Agree and Agree are mapped to `"Yes"`, and Disagree and Strongly disagree are mapped to `"No"`.
    The remaining levels can be left as is.
    Don't overwrite the existing `advfront`, instead pick a different, informative name for your new variable.
    
```{r}

library(dplyr)

gss16 <- gss16 %>%
  mutate(advfront_recode = case_when(
    advfront %in% c("Strongly agree", "Agree") ~ "Yes",
    advfront %in% c("Disagree", "Strongly disagree") ~ "No",
    TRUE ~ as.character(advfront)  # Keeps other values unchanged
  ))

```


11. In a new variable, recode `polviews` such that Extremely liberal, Liberal, and Slightly liberal, are mapped to `"Liberal"`, and Slghtly conservative, Conservative, and Extrmly conservative disagree are mapped to `"Conservative"`.
    The remaining levels can be left as is.
    Make sure that the levels are in a reasonable order.
    Don't overwrite the existing `polviews`, instead pick a different, informative name for your new variable.
    
```{r}
library(dplyr)

gss16 <- gss16 %>%
  mutate(polviews_recode = case_when(
    polviews %in% c("Extremely liberal", "Liberal", "Slightly liberal") ~ "Liberal",
    polviews %in% c("Slghtly conservative", "Conservative", "Extrmly conservative") ~ "Conservative",
    TRUE ~ as.character(polviews)
  )) 
```


12. Create a visualization that displays the relationship between these two new variables and interpret it.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(gss16, aes(x = polviews_recode, fill = advfront_recode)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill") + 
  labs(title = "Relationship Between Political Views and Support for Advancing Technology",
       x = "Political Views",
       y = "Proportion",
       fill = "Supports Advancing Technology") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) 
```
***They seem to be very similar responses for each party. Most people are in support of advancing technology. There is a little higher amount who aren't sure or do not support advancing technology from the conservative and NA categories.***
